# Step 2: Work with pre-trained speech model
-  Upload audio file to GCP notebook enviroment
-  Use speech to text API

# Step 3: Work with Pre-trained Vision Models
- Using GCP Vision API
  - Access Vision API, upload an Image, Detect Objects/Texts
    
- Using Azure AI Vision
  - Access AML Notebooks in Azure, Upload an Image and Use the Pre-trained model

### Comments
- Azure and GCP were relatively easy to use with the help of some online searches how to upload files, however, could not pass certain technical difficulties as stated above.
- Azure provided some Generative AI with prompt flow which could proved to be interesting.
- The notebook samples were a nice feature
