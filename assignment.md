- Access Azure Machine Learning (AML) Notebooks (Vision API in AML)


# Step 2: Work with pre-trained speech model
-  Upload audio file to GCP notebook enviroment
-  Use speech to text API

# Step 3: Work with Pre-trained Vision Models
- Using GCP Vision API
  - Access Vision API, upload an Image, Detect Objects/Texts
    
- Using Azure AI Vision
  - Access AML Notebooks in Azure, Upload an Image and Use the Pre-trained model
